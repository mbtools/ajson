# Installation

You can install the whole code using [abapGit](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit).

The tool is open source and distributed under MIT license.

The package contains 3 subpackages: `core` (the tool itself), `libs` (mapping, filtering, comparation tools, etc) and the `perf` - the tools to measure the performance. The latter can be skipped for the deserialization (abapGit supports filename filtering - specify `*/perf/*` in the corresponding repo setting).
